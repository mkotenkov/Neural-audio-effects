This project aims to find creative audio-effects with neural networks. I use the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) proposed by [Christian Steinmetz](https://csteinmetz1.github.io/steerable-nafx/NeurIPS_2021__Steerable_discovery_of_neural_audio_effects.pdf) and add some modifications to it: <br>
1) Module IntelligentMerge is supposed to provide the facilities to more complex merge of channels;<br>
2) Module WaveLearner allows the model to learn how to change the effect over time.<br><br>

Trained example-models are ready for use inside the [Neutone VST-plugin](https://neutone.space/plugin/)
